# 30-Days-of-Python – Learn Python in a Month

*This is how I learned Python in just 30 days! I've structured this repository from basics to advanced, covering key concepts with hands-on examples. By the end, I built some projects to show how I apply everything I learned.*

## How This Works?
- 📂 This repo documents my 30-day Python learning journey, each with its own Python file (Day_1.py, Day_2.py, ... Day_30.py).
- 💡 Every file covers a new topic, from basics to advanced concepts, just as I learned them.
- 🛠️ The last few days are about mini projects, where I applied everything I learned!
