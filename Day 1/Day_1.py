# Day 1: Introduction to Python & Setup

''' 
First Step: Installing Python
On Windows, I downloaded Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/
On Linux, it needs to be installed via the terminal. (Refer to official docs: https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html)
'''

'''
Second Step: Choosing an IDE
I’m using VS Code since I’m already familiar with it, but here are a few other IDEs that work great with Python:
- PyCharm
- VSCodium
- Eclipse
'''

# First Ever Program
print("Hello World") #classic first step

# Basic Arithmetic Operators
print(10 + 10) #addition
print(15 - 10) #subtraction
print(2 * 4) #multiplication
print(8 / 2) #division
print(9 // 2) #floor division
print(2 ** 3) #power
print(10 % 3) #modulus

'''
Unlike Java or C++, Python doesn’t require you to declare data types for variables.
'''

# Few Variables Declaration
name = "Ayush"
age = 20
height = 6.1
learning_python = True

print(name, age, height, learning_python)
